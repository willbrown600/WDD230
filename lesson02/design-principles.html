              <p>This is about where the human eye sees objects in there entirety before perceiving their indivual parts
                  which is clearly shown heree through the use of the takeaway coffee cups in the train set.

              <img src="/images/screenshot2.png" alt="Screenshot2">
                <p>The ranking in what captures the human eye on is the photo of the house. The website is all about real estate and that is what the consumers
                    want to see is the house images so the in the Visual Hierarchy the house should be the focus which it is here.

              <h4>Fitts Law</h4>
              <img src="/images/screenshot3.png" alt="Screenshot3">
                <p>Fitts Law is about the bigger the object and closer it is, the easier to use.
                    The house photo is the button and by providing it so big and close the user has only to choices skip or
                    push the button to access the details about the house.
